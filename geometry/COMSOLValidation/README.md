This folder holds configuration files and matched COMSOL files to validate the function of XEMFEM.

This is required as matching the more complex TPC geometry has prooved prohibitatively complex.

The examples include in 2D only (quicker to implement in both frameworks)

1. A simple parallel plate capacitor embedded in a volume. 

2. Eccentric coaxial cylinder. Idealized cross section of a coaxial cable with manufactoring defects (inner cylinder not in the center of the outer). 

3. Two wires of opposite polarity ie cathode and anode, verify small scale wire behavior. 

4. Slot / slit capacitor (capcaitor with a narrow gap and with tips)

5. Conducting wedge facing a plane, ie corner electrodes which produce a true singularity in the electric field
